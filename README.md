Features
Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a Linear Regression model trained on a financial dataset to forecast future balances.

Data Preprocessing: The model is built on a cleaned dataset where missing values are handled and outliers are managed through winsorization.

Interactive Web App: A user-friendly interface created with Streamlit allows for easy input of customer data and displays the prediction in real-time.

Technology Stack
Python: The core programming language.

pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

Scikit-learn: For building and training the machine learning model.

Streamlit: For creating the interactive web application.

Git & GitHub: For version control and code hosting.
